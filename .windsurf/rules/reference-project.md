The project at "C:\dev\stock-insights" (referred to as "SI") is the state-of-the-art reference project used to establish patterns for re-use in our project. When implementing new features or patterns, SI should be consulted as the source of best practices.
Important: Since SI is outside of our workspace, you must use the read_file tool with absolute paths to read files from it. Other tools like code_search and grep_search will not work on files outside the current workspace.
